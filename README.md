# NVIDIA_Stock_Prediction
Beginner Machine Learning Project Predicting NVIDIA Closing Prices Using Decision Tree Algorithm

## Project Overview

This project utilizes a Decision Tree Regressor to forecast NVIDIA stock closing prices for the next 21 days. By analyzing historical stock data, the model identifies trends and patterns, providing valuable insights for informed investment decisions.

## Methods Used

- **Data Cleaning**: Leveraging Python libraries like Pandas to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Employing Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visual representations of the data, enabling exploration of potential relationships and trends.
- **Model Training**: Utilizing scikit-learn to train the Decision Tree Regressor model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance through scikit-learn's mean squared error metric.
- **Model Deployment**: Saving the trained model with Pickle for future use.

## Dependencies
All required libraries are listed in the requirements.txt file. Ensure you have Python installed and use pip to install them. 

## Transparency Note
During the debugging process, Perplexity AI was used to assist with certain aspects of problem identification and resolution.
